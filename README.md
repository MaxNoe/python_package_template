# Python Package Template
A step-by-step introduction to python packaging


### Step 1 – Share your code
Add one of your many python scripts, that somebody asked you for.

> Hey this is cool stuff, i also need to do this often. Why don't you share it?

In this example, I will use a simplistic json to yaml converter.

### Step 2 – Create an installable python package

Make it an installable python package, so people can do:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/<myuser>/<mypackage>
```

### Step 3 – Unit tests

Add unit tests

### Step 4 – Continous Integration

Setup travis

### Step 5 – Proper documentation

Setup sphinx

### Step 6 – Publish

Deploy to (test)-PyPI using travis
